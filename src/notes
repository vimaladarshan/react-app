Let's get hooked

UI update based on varaible value changes. It is not possible with normal javascript varaible.

- To make it possible, we require super powerful variable called 'state variable'

#React hooks

- Normal JS utility function
  useState()
  It is a utility function available in react.
  If we declare useState, we are telling the react component to 'remember someting'

Syntax:
import {useState} from 'react'
const [variableName,setvariableName] = useState(defaultValue);
where variableName is for assigning default value to a state variable.
And where setvariableName is for updating state variable
In conclusion, whenever the state varaible changes, the react will re-render the components

\*\* why react is so fast?
React is good at DOM manipulation. It keeps sync the data layer with the UI layer.

React uses 'Reconcilation algorithm' also known as 'React fiber'.
This algorithm is a way of finding the difference between old virtual DOM and new virtual DOM and update the actual DOM.
virtual DOM is a Object representation of DOM. It is also known as a result of react create element.

Exploring the world:

Ep 06: part 01

Monolith - all components of a application tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit. i.e. In a monolith, the entire application, including the user interface, business logic, and data access layer, is packaged and deployed together.

Microservices architecture - Microservices architecture involves breaking down a large application into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through well-defined APIs.

Each service has its own codebase, database, and deployment process. They communicate with each other through well-defined APIs. For example, when a user places an order, the Cart Service might communicate with the Order Service to complete the order.

Ep 06: part 02
There are two ways for API call

When to make API call?
Page loads -> API -> Render UI with actual data
Page loads -> Render shimmer UI -> API -> Render UI with actual data (Better UX)

useEffect()

- It is to execute the call back function after the component is rendered.
- useEffect is a hook in React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- It is used for handling side effects in functional components.
- Side effects in the context of React typically include tasks such as data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations, and other operations that might affect the state or the UI.

Syntax:
useEffect(callbackFunction,dependencyArray[])

callbackfunction - It gets executed once the component is rendered.

We are going to use useEffect for achieving the better UX. i.e. render the page, fetch API and render the data.

fetch() - we are going to use the same method as we use for javascript.

- fetch method is given to us by browsers.
- fetch will return a promise
- either we resolve the promise with .then or we can use async await

## So finally rendered the data from API using fetch with async await

EP. 06 part 04

implementation of shimmer UI

EP. 06 part 05

Using ternary operator with return for conditional rendering is also can be done

use of useState with login <-> logout toggle

## The main use of useState is to reload or re-render the component once the state is getting updated

EP. 06 part 06

Search with input fields - using state variable for acheiving it

To overcome input field not editable issue while binding the value to the state variable, we should update the value with setState with onChange event.

using array.filter()

.includes() -> JS function to filter the array as like '%%' in mysql

Post what is react fiber in linked in - prepare the document with diagram for reference.

Successfully filter the data. But there is an issue.

If we do search, the filtered array got listed. If I again do search, it is always referring new filter array instead of old array in react. Because of state variable

EP 06, part 07: overcome above issue (i.e. filter over filter is happening instead of referring original array)

EP 6.1

Swiggy API issue resolved

EP 6.2

CORS plugin issue resolved with corsproxy.io

EP 07 : Finding the path

Part 01:

With empty dependency array:

useEffect(() => {
console.log("use effect called only once after component render");
}, []);

Without dependency array:

useEffect(() => {
console.log("Use effect called every time the component render");
});

With dependency array with value:

useEffect(() => {
console.log("use effect called after initial render and also called when the dependency array changes");
}, []);

Part 02:

Never use state variables outside the component

Never use state variables with in condition statement

Part 03:

Creating different route inside the react application

command to install react router

npm i react-router-dom

In the main component, import createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom to add routing configuration as below,

import {createBrowserRouter, routerProvider} from 'react-router-dom'
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
{
path:"/",
element:<Component/>,
errorElement:<ErrorComponent/>
},
{
path:"/aboutus",
element:<Component/>,
errorElement:<ErrorComponent/>
}
]);

And import routerProvider from react-router-dom to provide the routing as below

root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter}/>);

useRouteError:

It is the hook that could be used to get more details about router error

Part 04:

Keep the header static and change body part to dynamic render

To achieve it, we have to create children routes and use Outlet

import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

<Header></Header>
<Outlet></Outlet>
<Footer></Footer>

Don't use anchor tag for routing links.

## Instead use Link component from react-router-dom to achieve not reloading whole page, it will route to specific component to render

Two types of routing

1. Client side routing - will not make network call to load the page, just render the component based on routing configuration
2. Server side routing - will make network call to load the page

---

Part 05:

Loading specific page with params in routing config
{
path:"/viewDetails/:id",
element:<Component/>,
errorElement:<ErrorComponent/>
}

useParams is a hook in react, that can be used to get params from routing as below

- import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

  let inputParams = useParams();
  inputParams = inputParams.resid;

Ep.08 Part 01 - Lets get classy

Class based components

class ComponentName extends React.Component{
constructor(props){
super(props);
}
let {inputparams} = this.props
render(){
return (<div>

<p>Hello world</p>
<p>{inputparams.name}</p>
</div>)
}
}
export default ComponentName;

why include super keyword in constructor
When we call super() keyword in constructor, it will call the constructor from the parent class and to use properties for the component, we should use super(props)

---

Part 02:
Create a state variable inside a class based component. It should get initialized inside the constructor
constructor(props) {
super(props);
this.state = { count: 0 };
}

Part 03:
Updating state variable

- "Never update state variables directly"
  Like 'this.state.count = 1'
  Instead use 'this.setState({
  count:count+1
  })'

Part 04:
Life cycle of react class based components
componentDidMount
//This will get called once component mounted - usecase of this is to do API calls - Because of better UX. i.e. loading shimmer UI and then load API calls
componentDidMount(){

}
Parent <-> child 'componentDidMount' calling sequence as below;

Parent constructor called
parent render called
child constructor called
child render called
Child did mount called
Parent did mount called

Part 05:
What if parent component has multiple child class? - React will do the batching of all child class render phase and then batch the child class commit phase to make it fast

--- Batching - Render phase start ---
Parent constructor called
parent render called
First Child constructor called
First child render called
Second Child constructor called
Second child render called
--- Batching - Render phase end ---

--- Batching - commit phase start ---
First Child did mount called
Second Child did mount called
Parent did mount called
--- Batching - commit phase end ---

---

Refer react life cycle diagrams

React has two phases:

1 - Render phase
2 - Commit phase

In React, the render phase and the commit phase are key stages in the process of updating the user interface.

Render Phase:

- In the render phase, React determines what changes need to be made to the virtual DOM based on updates to component props or state.

- During this phase, React constructs a new virtual DOM representation of the UI by calling the render() method of each component.

- The render phase is where reconciliation occurs, which involves comparing the new virtual DOM with the previous one to identify the minimal set of changes needed to update the UI.

Commit Phase:

- In the commit phase, React applies the changes identified during the render phase to the actual DOM.

- This phase involves making the necessary updates to the real DOM to reflect the changes made in the virtual DOM.

- React optimizes this process by batching DOM updates and performing them in a single pass to minimize browser reflows and improve performance.

- After the commit phase, the updated UI is visible to the user.

It's important to note that React's reconciliation algorithm and the separation of render and commit phases are key factors in React's performance and ability to efficiently update the UI. By minimizing the number of actual DOM manipulations and optimizing the process of applying changes, React is able to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.

Part 06:
How to do make API calls inside class based component
async componentDidMount(){
let fetchAPI = await fetch();
fetchAPI = await fetchAPI.json()
}
According to react lifecycle, it executes componentDidMount after component rendered

componentDidUpdate(){ -- It will be executed once actual DOM rendered

}

componentWillUnMount(){ -- It will get called once before going to get unmounted

}

useEffect({
console.log('called after first render');
return ()=>{
console.log('called just before unmounting the component');
}
},[])

Part 07: Depth explanation of class components

why can't we use async keyword with useEffect()?
In functional components, you can use useEffect() to achieve a similar effect, but you cannot mark it as async. This is because useEffect() doesn't directly support async/await syntax within its definition. However, you can define an async function inside useEffect() and call it immediately.

Ep 09: Optimizing our app:

Part 01:
Distributing the code into smaller pieces of module, makes the code reusable, testable and maintainable.

Part 02:
Custom hooks

Part 03:
Project idea for custom hooks and share as a contribution:
useLocalStorage
useSessionStorage

Check online or offline custom hooks:
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
const useCheckInternetOnline = () => {
let [onlineStatus, setOnlineStatus] = useState(true);
useEffect(() => {
window.addEventListener("offline", () => {
setOnlineStatus(false);
});
window.addEventListener("online", () => {
setOnlineStatus(true);
});
}, []);

return onlineStatus;
};
export default useCheckInternetOnline;

Part 04:
Follow the conventions, like use 'use' before custom hooks, components in caps, try implementing the linting

Part 05:
To build large scale application, it is mandatory to chunk the code to load when it is required. It is also called as 'Lazy Loading' or 'On demand loading' or 'Dynamic import' or 'Dynamic Bundling' or 'Code splitting' or 'Chunking'.

import {lazy} from 'react';

const Grocery = lazy(()=>import("./components/Grocery"));

{
path:/grocery,
element:<Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading...</h1>}><Grocery/></Suspense>
}
